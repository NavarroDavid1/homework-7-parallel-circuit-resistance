# Project Overview
This project is designed to handle array manipulation using C, C++, and assembly. The program allows the user to input integers, stores them in an array on the stack, displays the array, reverses it using a C++ function, and calculates the mean using assembly.


# Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program:
1. Run `make` to compile the project.
2. Run `./main` to execute the program.

The Makefile ensures that the program is properly compiled and linked using GCC and NASM. The reverse function is written in C++, while array display and input/output are managed in assembly.
