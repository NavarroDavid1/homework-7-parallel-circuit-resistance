# Project Overview
This project implements a parallel circuit resistance calculator using a hybrid approach of C++, C, and Assembly. The program calculates resistance, current, and power metrics for n-resistor configurations, featuring:
- Dynamic memory allocation for variable resistor counts
- IEEE 754 floating-point calculations
- CPU cycle-level timing measurements
- ASCII circuit visualization with current flow
- Comprehensive power and resistance metrics


# Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program:
1. Run `make` to compile the project.
2. Run `./main` to execute the program.

The Makefile ensures proper compilation and linking using GCC, G++, and NASM for the hybrid implementation.
